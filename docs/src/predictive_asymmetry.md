# Predictive asymmetry

## Example: no coupling

Here, we'll compute the predictive asymmetry on 100 different sets of random time series. Because there is no
dynamical coupling between the time series, we expect the predictive asymmetry to be zero.

We'll use a visitation frequency estimator.

```@example predictiveasymmetry
using CausalityTools, Plots, StatsBase

# Define prediction lags and estimator
Œ∑s = 1:10
est = VisitationFrequency(RectangularBinning(5)) # guess that 5 bins along each coordinate axis is sufficient

nreps = 100
ùî∏xy = zeros(nreps, length(Œ∑s))
ùî∏yx = zeros(nreps, length(Œ∑s))

for i = 1:nreps
    # Some example time series
    x, y = rand(1000), rand(1000)
    ùî∏xy[i, :] = predictive_asymmetry(x, y, est, Œ∑s) 
    ùî∏yx[i, :] = predictive_asymmetry(y, x, est, Œ∑s) 
end

plot()
plot!(Œ∑s, dropdims(mean(ùî∏xy, dims = 1), dims = 1), label = "X to Y", c = :black)
plot!(Œ∑s, dropdims(mean(ùî∏yx, dims = 1), dims = 1), label = "Y to X", c = :red)
ylims!((-0.1, 0.1))

As expected, because there is no dynamical coupling between the variables, the predictive asymmetry is around zero for all prediction lags.

## Example: coupled Ulam maps

Here, we'll use the same example as in Schreiber's transfer entropy paper and see if the predictive asymmetry 
is able to decipher the directional coupling in the Ulam system.

Let's start by defining the Ulam system. Then, we generate time series for different values of the 
parameter `Œµ` and compute the predictive asymmetry for prediction lags `Œ∑s = 1:10`.

We expect that the predictive asymmetry is positive if there is a directional coupling, and zero or negative 
if there is no directional coupling.

```@example predasym_ulam
using DynamicalSystems, CausalityTools, Plots, Random, StatsBase, TimeseriesSurrogates

Random.seed!(12234)

function ulam_system(dx, x, p, t)
    f(x) = 2 - x^2
    Œµ = p[1]
    dx[1] = f(Œµ*x[length(dx)] + (1-Œµ)*x[1])
    for i in 2:length(dx)
        dx[i] = f(Œµ*x[i-1] + (1-Œµ)*x[i])
    end
end

ds = DiscreteDynamicalSystem(ulam_system, rand(100) .- 0.5, [0.04])
trajectory(ds, 1000; Ttr = 1000)

Œµs = 0.02:0.02:1.0
Œ∑s = 1:10
pas_x1x2 = zeros(length(Œµs), length(Œ∑s)); 
pas_x2x1 = zeros(length(Œµs), length(Œ∑s))

for (i, Œµ) in enumerate(Œµs)
    set_parameter!(ds, 1, Œµ)
    # Use time series consisting of 1000 points
    tr = trajectory(ds, 1000; Ttr = 5000)
    X1 = tr[:, 1]; X2 = tr[:, 2]
    @assert !any(isnan, X1)
    @assert !any(isnan, X2)
    binning = RectangularBinning(0.2) # guess an appropriate bin width of 0.2
    pas_x1x2[i, :] = predictive_asymmetry(X1, X2, VisitationFrequency(binning), Œ∑s)
    pas_x2x1[i, :] = predictive_asymmetry(X2, X1, VisitationFrequency(binning), Œ∑s)
end
```

Let's pick the predictive asymmetry at prediction lag `Œ∑ = 10`. 

```@example predasym_ulam
# Pick predictive asymmetry at Œ∑ = 10
pa_x1x2 = [pas_x1x2[i, end] for i = 1:length(Œµs)]
pa_x2x1 = [pas_x2x1[i, end] for i = 1:length(Œµs)]

plot()
plot(Œµs, pa_x1x2, label = "X1 to X2", c = :black, lw = 1.5)
plot!(Œµs, pa_x2x1, label = "X2 to X1", c = :red)
xlabel!("epsilon")
ylabel!("Predictive asymmetry (bits)")
hline!([0], ls = :dash, label = "", c = :grey)
savefig("predasym.svg") # hide
```

As expected, predictive asymmetry is positive in the direction ``X_1 \\to X_2``, and 
negative in the direction ``X_2 \\to X_1``.

Are the results significant? We can test that using a surrogate test. We'll use random
shuffle surrogates from the `TimeseriesSurrogates.jl` package. 

Using the same parameters, as before, we generate time series for the same values of 
`Œµs`, but for each `Œµ`, we generate 100 different shuffled versions of the source time 
series. For each of those surrogate time series, we compute the predictive asymmetry
and pick the value at `Œ∑ = 10`

```@example predasym_ulam
n_surr = 100
pas_x1x2_surr = zeros(length(Œµs), n_surr); 
pas_x2x1_surr = zeros(length(Œµs), n_surr)

for (i, Œµ) in enumerate(Œµs)
    set_parameter!(ds, 1, Œµ)
    tr = trajectory(ds, 1000; Ttr = 5000)
    X1 = tr[:, 1]; @assert !any(isnan, X1)
    X2 = tr[:, 2]; @assert !any(isnan, X2)
    S1 = surrogenerator(X1, RandomShuffle())
    S2 = surrogenerator(X2, RandomShuffle())

    binning = RectangularBinning(0.2) # guess an appropriate bin width of 0.2

    pas_x1x2_surr[i, :] = [predictive_asymmetry(S1(), X2, VisitationFrequency(binning), Œ∑s)[end] for k = 1:n_surr]
    pas_x2x1_surr[i, :] = [predictive_asymmetry(S2(), X1, VisitationFrequency(binning), Œ∑s)[end] for k = 1:n_surr]
end
```

We'll plot the 95th percentile of the surrogate ensemble predictive asymmetries (dashed lines) along with the original
predictive asymmetries (solid lines). If the predictive asymmetry computed on the original time series exceed that of the 95th percentile of the surrogate ensemble, then the predictive asymmetry is significant.

```@example predasym_ulam
uq_x1x2 = [quantile(pas_x1x2_surr[i, :], 0.95) for i = 1:length(Œµs)]
uq_x2x1 = [quantile(pas_x2x1_surr[i, :], 0.95) for i = 1:length(Œµs)]
ymax = maximum(abs.([pa_x1x2; pa_x2x1; uq_x1x2; uq_x2x1]))*1.1
plot(ylims = (-ymax, ymax))
plot!(Œµs, pa_x1x2, label = "X1 to X2", c = :black, lw = 1.5)
plot!(Œµs, uq_x1x2, label = "X1 to X2", c = :black, ls = :dot)
plot!(Œµs, pa_x2x1, label = "X2 to X1", c = :red)
plot!(Œµs, uq_x2x1, label = "X2 to X1", c = :red, ls = :dot)

The predictive asymmetry in the direction ``X_1 \\to X_2`` is above the 95th percentile of the surrogates for most parameters. Thus, we reject the null hypothesis that ``X_1`` does not influence ``X_2`` and accept the alternative hypothesis that ``X_1`` does in fact influence ``X_2``. In the context of causal inference, this means that there is evidence of directional dynamical coupling from ``X_1`` to ``X_2`` and that ``X_1`` is causally coupled to ``X_2``. 

In the oppposite direction, ``X_2 \\to X_1``, where there should not be any directional coupling (by definition), the predictive asymmetries are below the surrogates, so we cannot reject the null hypothesis that ``X_2`` does not influence ``X_1``. Hence, there is no evidence of directional dynamical coupling from ``X_2`` to  ``X_1``.
