# [Experimental](@ref experimental_methods)

Here we list implemented methods that do not yet appear in peer-reviewed journals,
but are found, for example, in pre-print servers like [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/).

The API for these methods, and their return values, may change at any time until
they appear as part of the public API. Use them wisely.
