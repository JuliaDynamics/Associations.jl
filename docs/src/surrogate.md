# Surrogate data

Surrogate time series can be used for hypothesis testing in time series causality analyses. 

The [TimeseriesSurrogates.jl](https://github.com/JuliaDynamics/Entropies.jl) package provides methods for generating surrogate time series. Relevant methods are re-exported here for convenience. For more details, see its package documentation.
