## Dedicated estimators

Here we list functions which compute Shannon entropies via alternate means, without explicitly computing some probability distributions and then using the Shannon formula.

## Convenience functions

In this subsection we expand documentation strings of "entropy names" that are used commonly in the literature, such as "permutation entropy". As we made clear in [API & terminology](@ref), these are just the existing Shannon entropy with a particularly chosen probability estimator. We have only defined convenience functions for the most used names, and arbitrary more specialized convenience functions can be easily defined in a couple lines of code.
