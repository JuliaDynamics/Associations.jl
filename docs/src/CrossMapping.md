# Cross mapping

Given two data series,
the putative `driver` and the putative `response`, the the `crossmap(driver, response; kwargs...)` function computes how well a delay
embedding of `response` predicts scalar values of `driver`. This is the original cross mapping algorithm from Sugihara et al. [^1].

To perform lagged CCM analysis [^2] as Ye et al., you can tune the `Î½` parameter.

## Cross map over multiple time series lengths

To perform a convergent cross map analysis as in [^1] one can apply the `crossmap` functions on time series of increasing length. The
`convergentcrossmap(driver, response, timeserieslengths; kwargs...)` function
does so by applying `crossmap` for each time series length in
`timeserieslengths`, where time windows always start at the first data point.
