# Surrogate method overview

The method of surrogate data is commonly used in the analysis of dynamical systems.
For an overview of surrogate methods, see the recent review by
[Lancaster et al., 2018](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.physrep.2018.06.001).

## What is a surrogate realization?
A surrogate realization of a dataset is a dataset that is formed either by shuffling the values of the original dataset in a particular way. There are two main ways of creating the data: constrained realizations and typical
realizations ([Theiler & Prichard, 1996](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/0167278996000504)).

### Constrained realizations
Constrained surrogate realizations are formed by shuffling the values of the
input data series in a way that retains some property of the original data. For example,
random shuffle surrogates (`randomshuffle`) retain the histogram of the data.
AAFT surrogates (`aaft`) aim to preserve the periodogram of the original data series.  

### Typical realizations
Typical surrogate realizations are generated by first fitting a model to the
input data, then generating new data from that model. Random phase Fourier
surrogates (`randomphases`), for example, retain the amplitudes of the original data, but shuffles the phases.


## Implemented algorithms
The following surrogate methods are implemented. Function documentation and
basic examples are available from the menu. For more details and demonstrations,
visit the [`TimeseriesSurrogates.jl documentation`](https://kahaaga.github.io/TimeseriesSurrogates.jl/latest/).

| Fourier transform phase surrogates  | `randomphases`  |  Typical  |  |
| Fourier transform amplitude surrogates  | `randomamplitudes`  |  Typical |   |
