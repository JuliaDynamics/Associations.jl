The method of surrogate data is commonly used in the analysis of dynamical systems.
For an overview of surrogate methods, see the recent review by [^1].

## What is a surrogate realization?

A surrogate realization of a dataset is a dataset that is formed either by 
shuffling the values of the original dataset in a particular way. There are 
two main ways of creating the data: constrained realizations and typical 
realizations [^4].

### Constrained realizations

Constrained surrogate realizations are formed by shuffling the values of the
input data series in a way that retains some property of the original data.

For example, random shuffle surrogates (`randomshuffle`) retain the histogram of the data, while
AAFT surrogates (`aaft`) aim to preserve the periodogram of the original data series.  

### Typical realizations

Typical surrogate realizations are generated by first fitting a model to the
input data, then generating new data from that model.

For example, random phase Fourier surrogates (`randomphases`) retain the 
amplitudes of the original data, but shuffles the phases.

## Implemented algorithms

The following surrogate methods are implemented. Function documentation and
basic examples are available from the menu. For more details and demonstrations,
visit the [`TimeseriesSurrogates.jl documentation`](https://kahaaga.github.io/TimeseriesSurrogates.jl/latest/).

| Algorithm  | Function  | Type  | Reference  |
|---|---|---|---|
| Randomly shuffling the values of the dataset  | `randomshuffle`  | Constrained  | [^3] |
| Fourier transform phase surrogates  | `randomphases`  |  Typical  |  |
| Fourier transform amplitude surrogates  | `randomamplitudes`  |  Typical |   |
| Amplitude-adjusted Fourier transform surrogates (AAFT) | `aaft`  | Constrained  | [^3] |
| Iterated amplitude-adjusted Fourier transform surrogates (iAAFT) | `iaaft`  | Constrained  | [^2], [^4] |

## Valid inputs

Random shuffle surrogates may be generated from the following inputs:

- `AbstractArray{T, 1}` instances (scalar-valued data series).

- `AbstractArray{Number, 2}` instances (multivarate scalar-valued data series), for which surrogates are generated column-wise.

- `Dataset` instances from [DynamicalSystems.jl](https://github.com/JuliaDynamics/DynamicalSystems.jl), for which surrogates are generated column-wise.
