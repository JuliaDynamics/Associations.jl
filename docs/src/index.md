# Overview

CausalityTools.jl is a package that provides algorithms for causal inference from time series.

CausalityTools.jl is part of [JuliaDynamics](https://juliadynamics.github.io/JuliaDynamics/), a GitHub organization dedicated to creating high quality scientific software.

The package is maintained by the [Earth System Evolution](https://www.earthsystemevolution.com/) group at the 
University of Bergen, Norway.

## Installation 

Install the latest stable version by running the following in the Julia repl:

```julia
using Pkg; Pkg.add("CausalityTools")
```

## Citing

If using any of the algorithms for scientific research, please cite the original research paper(s) referenced in the docstrings. 


## Utilities 

n addition to causal inference methods, we also provide algorithms for:

- transfer operator approximation 
- invariant distribution estimation
- time series surrogate generation.
