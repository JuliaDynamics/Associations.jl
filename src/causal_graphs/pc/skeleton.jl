"""
    skeleton(algorithm::PC, x) → (g, s)

Infer the skeleton graph for the variables `x` using the provided `algorithm`.
`x` must be some iterable where the `i`-th variable can be accessed as `x[i]`.

Return a tuple of the undirected skeleton graph `g::SimpleGraph`, and the
separating sets `s::Dict{SimpleEdge, Vector{Int}})`.

    skeleton_unconditional!(alg::PC, g::SimpleGraph, x)

Perform pairwise independence tests between all vertices in the `graph`, where
each vertex is represented by the data `x[i]`, and remove any edges in `graph`
where adjacent vertices are found to be independent according to the given independence
`test`. The null hypothesis of independence is rejected
whenever the p-value is below `α`.

This is essentially algorithm 3.2 in [Colombo2014](@citet), but only
considering the case `𝓁 = 0`.

Modifies `graph` in-place.

If `alg.pairwise_test` is a directed test, then edges are considered one-by-one.
If `alg.pairwise_test` is not a directed test, then edges (`X → Y, `Y → X`)
are considered simultaneously.

Thin the skeleton `graph`, where each vertex is represented by the data `x[i]`,
