"""
    GraphAlgorithm

The supertype of all algorithms used to infer causal relationships from graphs.
Each [`GraphAlgorithm`](@ref) returns some graph that is compatible with the
[Graphs.jl](https://github.com/JuliaGraphs/Graphs.jl) package, which can be used
to explore the inferred graphs further.

Concrete subtypes are:

abstract type GraphAlgorithm end

"""
    infer_graph(algorithm::GraphAlgorithm, x) â†’ g

Infer graph from input data `x` using the given `algorithm`.

Returns a graph `g`, whose type depends on `algorithm`.
