    Lindner <: TransferEntropyEstimator
    Lindner(k = 1, w = 0, base = MathConstants.e)

The `Lindner` transfer entropy estimator (Lindner et al., 2011)[^Lindner2011], which is
also used in the Trentool MATLAB toolbox, and is based on nearest neighbor searches.

`w` is the Theiler window, which determines if temporal neighbors are excluded
during neighbor searches (defaults to `0`, meaning that only the point itself is excluded
when searching for neighbours).

## Description

For a given points in the joint embedding space `j·µ¢`, this estimator first computes the
distance `d·µ¢` from `j·µ¢` to its `k`-th nearest neighbor. Then, for each point `m‚Çñ[i]` in
the `k`-th marginal space, it counts the number of points within radius `d·µ¢`.

The transfer entropy is then computed as

```math
TE(X \\to Y) =
\\psi(k) + \\dfrac{1}{N} \\sum_{i}^n
\\left[
    \\sum_{k=1}^3 \\left( \\psi(m_k[i] + 1) \\right)
\\right],
```

where the index `k` references the three marginal subspaces `T`, `TùíØ` and `ST` for which
neighbor searches are performed.
