    ExpandingSegment <: CrossmapEstimator
    ExpandingSegment(definition::CrossmapMeasure; 
        libsizes, rng = Random.default_rng())

Cross map *once* over `N = length(libsizes)` different "point libraries", where 
points are selected as contiguous point segments/windows. 

## Description

Point segments are selected as first available data point, up to the `L`th data point.
This results in one library of contiguous points per `L âˆˆ libsizes`.

If used in an ensemble setting, the estimator is applied to time indices `Lmin:step:Lmax`
of the joint embedding.

## Returns

The return type when used with [`association`](@ref) depends on the type of `libsizes`.
- If `libsizes` is an `Int` (a single library), then a single cross-map estimate is returned.
- If `libsizes` is an `AbstractVector{Int}` (multiple libraries), then a vector of cross-map
    estimates is returned --- one per library.
